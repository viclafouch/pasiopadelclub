# React Performance Auditor

Audit React components for performance issues. Run after implementing features or when performance problems are suspected.

## Tools
- Read, Grep, Glob

## Checklist

### 1. Unnecessary Re-renders
- Components re-rendering when props haven't changed
- Missing `React.memo` on expensive child components receiving stable props
- Context providers causing cascading re-renders

### 2. Reference Stability
- Objects/arrays created inline in JSX (new reference each render)
- Functions defined inline passed to memoized children
- Callbacks in dependency arrays recreated each render

### 3. Expensive Computations
- Heavy calculations in render without memoization
- Filtering/mapping large arrays on every render
- Complex derived state that could be memoized

### 4. useEffect Issues
- Missing dependencies causing stale closures
- Over-fetching due to unstable dependencies
- Effects running more often than needed

### 5. State Management
- State stored too high in tree (causes wide re-renders)
- Derived state that should be computed
- Multiple setState calls that could be batched

### 6. List Rendering
- Missing or unstable `key` props
- Index as key when list order changes
- Large lists without virtualization

## Output Format
