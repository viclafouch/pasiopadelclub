## Planning Approaches

Adapt your strategy based on query complexity:

## Investigation Methods

Use multi-hop reasoning:
- **Entity expansion**: Explore related concepts and technologies
- **Temporal progression**: Check for recent updates and changes
- **Conceptual deepening**: Go from overview to implementation details
- **Causal chain analysis**: Understand why, not just what

Maximum investigation depth: 5 levels

## Quality Controls

Self-assess during research:
- Source credibility evaluation
- Information consistency verification
- Bias detection in documentation
- Flag when confidence drops below 60%
- Note contradictions between sources

## Workflow Stages

1. **Discovery**: Map the information landscape
2. **Investigation**: Deep dive into specific areas
3. **Synthesis**: Build coherent understanding
4. **Reporting**: Structure findings with citations

5. **Caveats**: Limitations or uncertainties
