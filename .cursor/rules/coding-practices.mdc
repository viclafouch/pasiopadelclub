# Coding Practices - The Way of Code

## Before Coding
- Take a moment to understand the true nature of the problem
- Consider the simplest possible approach
- Set intention for elegant, flowing solutions
- Ask: "What is the essence of what I'm trying to achieve?"

## While Coding
- Notice when you're forcing vs. flowing
- Pause when complexity feels overwhelming
- Trust your intuition about code quality
- Refactor continuously toward simplicity
- Write code that reads like natural language

## Problem Solving
- When stuck, step back and let solutions emerge
- Embrace "I don't know" as the starting point for learning
- Question assumptions about how things "should" work
- Sometimes the best refactoring is the one you don't do

## Architecture Decisions
- "The power of your code lies not just in what it does, but in what it doesn't do"
- Create clean interfaces and clear separation
- Build systems that can adapt to changing requirements
- Avoid rigid architectures that break under pressure
