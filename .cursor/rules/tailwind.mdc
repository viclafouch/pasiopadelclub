# Overview

## General Guidelines
- Use Tailwind utility classes for consistent styling, with custom CSS only for special cases
- Organize classes logically (layout, spacing, color, typography)
- Use responsive and state variants (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:, hover:, focus:, dark:) in markup
- Embrace Tailwind v4 features like container queries and CSS variables
- Rely on Tailwind classes rather than inline styles or external CSS files for a unified design language

## Configuration (CSS Files)
- Use the `@theme` directive to define custom design tokens like fonts, breakpoints, and colors
- Prefer modern color formats such as `oklch` for better color gamut support, defining them in the `:root` scope
- Take advantage of automatic content detection, which eliminates the need for a `content` array in configuration
- Add specific sources with `@source` only when necessary
- Extend Tailwind with custom utilities using the `@utility` directive in CSS files

## Styling (CSS Files)
- Incorporate 3D transform utilities like `rotate-x-*`, `rotate-y-*`, and `scale-z-*` for advanced visual effects
- Implement container queries with `@container`, `@max-*`, and `@min-*` utilities for adaptive layouts
- Check browser support for advanced features like `@starting-style` using resources like caniuse

## Components (HTML)
- Apply Tailwind utility classes directly in HTML for styling components
- Use dynamic arbitrary values like `grid-cols-[1fr_500px_2fr]` for flexible layouts
- Implement data attribute variants like `data-current:opacity-100` for conditional styling
- Ensure accessibility by pairing Tailwind utilities with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Use `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"` when applying utilities like `hidden` or `sr-only`
