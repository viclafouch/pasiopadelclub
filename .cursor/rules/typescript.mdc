# Overview

- For complex objects or arrays (e.g., arrays of objects), use `as const` or `as const satisfies T` to preserve literal types and ensure structural correctness.

Example:
```typescript
import type { LinkOptions } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const navLinks = [
  { linkOptions: { to: '/' }, label: 'Accueil' },
  { linkOptions: { to: '/' }, label: 'Nos terrains' },
  { linkOptions: { to: '/' }, label: 'Tarifs' },
  { linkOptions: { to: '/' }, label: 'Contact' }
] as const satisfies { linkOptions: LinkOptions; label: string }[]
```

## Type Design
- Prefer simple, clear type definitions over complex ones
- Use union types and discriminated unions for clarity
- Let TypeScript infer types when it's obvious
- Create types that express intent, not just structure

## Error Handling
- Use Result types or proper error boundaries
- Validate at system boundaries with runtime checks
- Prefer explicit error handling over throwing exceptions
- Make error states visible in the type system

## Code Organization
- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Export only what needs to be public
- Use barrel exports sparingly

## Best Practices
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer `const` assertions for immutable data
- Use Zod or similar for runtime validation
- Write code that reads naturally, even with types
