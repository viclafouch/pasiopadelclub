# Overview

- Do not insert empty lines in JSX.
- JSX elements must be written without blank lines between them.
- Never add visual spacing inside JSX using empty lines.
- Always add "import React from 'react'" in top of jsx files.
- When creating props for a component, always create the type like `type ComponentNameProps = {...}` and reuse it.
- Always use the `React.` prefix for all exports from the 'react' library (e.g., `React.useState`, `React.useEffect`, `React.ReactNode`).
